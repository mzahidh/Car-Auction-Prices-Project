# Car Auction Prices Project
EDA and Machine Learning Modelling Using Python

In this project, there are 4 steps that I do:

**1. Data Preparation (Data Cleaning)**
  - Extract Raw Data
  - Fill and Drop Null Values
  - Standardization Values
  - Load Clean Data to CSV and Local MySQL Database

**2. Exploration Data Analysis**
  - Find Insight using Matplotlib and Seaborn
  - Outlier Analysis
  - Find Best and Worst Seller using Quantile Analysis
  
**3. Machine Learning Modelling**
  - Prediction Prices Cars using Regression
  - Clustering Quality of Cars using KMeans Clustering
  
**4. Hypothesis Testing using MannWhitneyU**

The dataset contains historical car auction sales prices, scraped from the outside internet sources collected in 2015. This dataset taken from kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/used-car-auction-prices).

This dataset contains 491641 rows and 15 columns.
